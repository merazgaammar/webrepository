        <h2 class="sous-header-size">Topic 1: Microcontroller and their role in <abbr>Internet of Things (IoT)</abbr>
        </h2>

        <h3 class="sous-header-size2">Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital
            machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to
            transfer data over a network without requiring
            human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. It is estimated that there will be more than 20 billion IoT
            devices connected in the next decade. This workshop uses hands-on examples to show the working of an
            embedded processor and its function
            in the IoT. The ESP32 board from Espressif is used for this workshop. The chip includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
            capabilities. During the workshop the chip architecture and capabilities will be explained. Also, an
            introduction to Arduino language,
            which will be used to program the chip, will be also be provided. During the workshop detailed and step by
            step hands-on experiments will be presented. The experiments will introduce the attendees to IoT technology
            and how it is applied in
            real world.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sous-header-size">Topic 2: <abbr> FPGAs </abbr>technologies and their application Configurable
            computing
        </h2>

        <h3 class="sous-header-size2">Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            Over the last 30 years FPGA design applications have increased exponentially. They have moved from designs
            only involving digital logic to other areas such as embedded controllers, Digital Signal Processing,
            communication, and configurable computing.
            The Xilinx Zynq FPGA family is a perfect example of how far FPGA's have come, providing plenty of FPGA
            fabric and two embedded ARM hard cores that can implement a full blown Linux Operating System. This has made
            exposure to and mastering of
            FPGAs very important to many people in the industry and academia. It utilizes a mixture of theory and hands
            on laboratories to give students what they need to know in VHDL programming, simulation and implementation
            of multi-disciplinary applications
            targeting FPGAs. Labs and homework are provided to reinforce the key concepts.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sous-header-size"> Topic3: Real Time <abbr> Operation System (RTOS)</abbr> : A hands on approach
        </h2>

        <h3 class="sous-header-size2">Abstract </h3>
        <p>
            A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system (OS) intended to serve real-time applications
            that process data as it comes in, typically less than tenths of seconds or shorter increments of time. They
            either are event driven or time sharing.
            Event driven systems switch between tasks based on their priorities while time sharing systems switch the
            task based on clock interrupts. Most RTOSs use a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm. RTOS are found in
            critical system as critical process
            controls, aviation and others. This talk provides an overview of a RTOS architecture. It uses a ARM32 board
            to demonstrate application design, development and debugging.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sous-header-size">Topic4: Model-based And Mechatronics System Engineering</h2>

        <h3 class="sous-header-size2">Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) is multi-disciplinary, distributed system engineering and based on a
            model-centric engineering methodology instead of the traditional document-centric methodology. MBSE
            encompasses behavioral analysis, system architecture,
            requirement traceability, performance analysis, modeling and simulation, verification and validation for the
            architecture and development of complex systems of systems (SoS) throughout its life cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mechatronics Systems Engineering: Mechatronics will be defined as multidisciplinary systems engineering and
            its applications discussed. The mechatronics design methodology as the optimal methodology in modern
            engineering design will be discussed. This
            will be followed by case studies on mechatronic systems design.
